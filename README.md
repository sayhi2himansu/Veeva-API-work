# Veeva API Python scripting to download viewable rendition in Bulk.

### Need of this script, WHY?
In veeva vault Renditions refer to the pdf version of the uploaded file but it doesn't include the signature rendition. Viewable rendition option downloads the PDF file including the signature rendition at the end or start of the document based on vault configurations. This option is available on the UI to manually downalod the viewable rendition but when the case is to download bulk Viewable Renditions during the migration activity - then there's a need to code.
